    <h1>Exploring the World of Literature</h1>
    <p>
      Classic novels have had a profound impact on literature by shaping the
      themes, narratives and character archetypes that continue to influence
      modern storytelling. For instance, <strong>Pride and Prejudice</strong> by
      Jane Austen explore<em>class and social dynamics,</em> while 1984 by
      George Orwell delves into the chilling of
      <em>totalitarianism and surveillance.</em> In
      <strong>To Kill a Mockingbird,</strong> Harper Lee addresses
      <em>racial injustice and moral growth.</em> Meanwhile,
      <strong>Moby-Dick</strong> by Herman Melville examines the obession with
      revenge and <strong>The Great Gatsby</strong> by F.Scott Fitzgerald
      critiques the pursuit of the American Dream. These works have not only
      provided enduring literary value but have also sparked critical
      discussions and inspired countless adaptions. Here are the classic novels
      and their authors in an ordered list:
