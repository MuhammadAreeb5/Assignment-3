    <h1>Exploring the World of Literature</h1>
    <p>Classic novels have had a profound impact on literature by shaping the themes, narratives and character
        archetypes that continue to influence modern storytelling. For instance, <strong>Pride and Prejudice</strong> by
        Jane Austen explore<em>class and social dynamics,</em> while 1984 by George Orwell delves into the chilling of
        <em>totalitarianism and surveillance.</em> In <strong>To Kill a Mockingbird,</strong> Harper Lee addresses
        <em>racial injustice and moral growth.</em> Meanwhile, <strong>Moby-Dick</strong> by Herman Melville examines
        the obession with revenge and <strong>The Great Gatsby</strong> by F.Scott Fitzgerald critiques the pursuit of
        the American Dream. These works have not only provided enduring literary value but have also sparked critical
        discussions and inspired countless adaptions. Here are the classic novels and their authors in an ordered list:
